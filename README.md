# MA Immunization COVID-19 Vaccines sites watcher

### Why?

The MA Immunization website is simply horrible ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 

The other websites that aggregate infos are OK, but they need to be refreshed ü§Ø.

This project uses command line üöÄ, makes a request every few seconds ‚è∞ and prints in the terminal üêö direct links to the site to book an appointment for the available date. 

Right now it supports the few locations closer to Boston: others can be added in `urls.py`. 

### Requirements üõí
Python 3 (2 is dead) is the only requirement.
If you are not sure which python you are running, then try to run 
```shell
> python --version
```
If it says something like `2.7` you are probably running the system python. 
In this case you will probably have also a `python3` and a `pip3` available, 
but you might need to run `pip3` as superuser.

```shell
> git clone https://github.com/giocalitri/maimmunization_watcher.git
> cd maimmunization_watcher
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to use üîß

```shell
> python watch_site.py
```

#### Notes ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Remember that, on Mac, Command ‚åò + Mouse Click opens the link directly in the browser
- Remember to stop the script when not using it. There is throttling implemented, but you do not want your IP banneded for running it for days straight!
