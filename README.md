# MA Immunization COVID-19 Vaccines sites watcher

### Why?

The MA Immunization website is simply horrible. 

The other websites that aggregate infos are OK, but they need to be refreshed.

This makes a request every few seconds and prints direct links to the result.

Right now it supports few locations: others can be added in `urls.py`. 

### How to use
```shell
> pip install -f requirements.txt
> python watch_site.py
```
